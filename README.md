## Key findings

Alcohol is the most significant predictor of quality wine so interestingly, wines with higher alcohol contents have higher quality.

## Motivation 

I love wine! Not only is it good for the heart, its good for sleep. There is no way to make a night/meal more memorable than opening a bottle of wine. I became interested in creating this project after dinner with one of my best mates. We were having a conversation about why the expensive bottles of wine seem to also get you just a little more tispier. He said "there's probably more alcohol in it, so because you are drunk you think its better, everthing is better when you are drunk." ....I wanted to find out!


## Data Source

- [Vinho Verde Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains one categorical response variable (High or Poor) quality wine and 12 physicochemical predictor variables. The 12 physicochemical predictor variables are: Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, and Alcohol. The response variable is quality. It was originally ranked on a scale of 1-10 with 1 through 5 being wine of poor quality and 6 through 10 being wine high quality. We changed this to 1 for high quality and 0 for poor quality. There are 1599 wine variants.

    * Residuals vs. fitted value
    * Variance Inflaction Factors, Cook‚Äôs distance, and High Leverage
- Model Selection- Stepwise Regression
    * AIC stepwise regression
    * BIC stepwise regression
    * Two-way interaction effects
- Final Model
    * Summary of the parameter estimates, standard errors, and p-values
    * Table of the odds ratios and their confidence intervals
- Model Diagnostics
    * P-values for goodness-of-fit test and likelihood ratio test
    * Deviance residuals vs. fitted values plot
    * Influence diagnostics analysis (Cook‚Äôs distance, leverage)
    * ROC plot

The final model had an AUC of 0.84 thus the model correctly predicted 84% of the data with a specificity of 0.71 and sensitivity of 0.82. The cutoff is 0.44 with a false positive rate of 0.29.

## Lessons Learned and Recommendations

- Log of Alcohol was the most significant predictor in the final model so interestingly, wines with higher alcohol contents have higher quality. 
- Residual sugar was one of the first predictors removed using stepwise regression. It seems that residual sugar has no significance towards the quality of wine.
- Given that a wine's alcohol percentage is determined during the fermentation process, when sugar is converted to alcohol by yeast a winemaker can opt to prolong that process and produce a higher ABV to potentially increase the perceived quality of their wine. 

## Limitations and What Can Be Improved

- Perceptions of quality are generally subjective. Individuals have different perferences thus, opinions of quality differ. 
- This analysis only considers physicochemical factors, other factors such as types of grapes used, how long the wine was aged for, location (considering the effects of weather) were not considered. A better model could have been produced and we would have been able to examine the impact of these aforementioned factors to the quality of Vinho Verde wine.
