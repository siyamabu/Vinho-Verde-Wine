## Key findings

Alcohol is the most significant predictor of quality wine so interestingly, wines with higher alcohol contents have higher quality.

## Motivation 

## Data Source

- [Vinho Verde Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains one categorical response variable (High or Poor) quality wine and 12 physicochemical predictor variables. The 12 physicochemical predictor variables are: Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, and Alcohol. The response variable is quality. It was originally ranked on a scale of 1-10 with 1 through 5 being wine of poor quality and 6 through 10 being wine high quality. We changed this to 1 for high quality and 0 for poor quality. There are 1599 wine variants.


## Methods

- Data Characteristics
    * Graphical summaries of the individual variables
    * Transformation of highly skewed variables
    * Scatterplot amtrix
    * Heat map of all the pairwise correlations
- First Order Model With all Predictor Variable
    * Jittered response vs. predicted values with the fitted logistic curve and a lowess fit
    * Residuals vs. fitted value
    * Variance Inflaction Factors, Cook‚Äôs distance, and High Leverage
- Model Selection- Stepwise Regression
    * AIC stepwise regression
    * BIC stepwise regression
    * Two-way interaction effects
- Final Model
    * Summary of the parameter estimates, standard errors, and p-values
    * Table of the odds ratios and their confidence intervals
- Model Diagnostics
    * P-values for goodness-of-fit test and likelihood ratio test
    * Deviance residuals vs. fitted values plot
    * Influence diagnostics analysis (Cook‚Äôs distance, leverage)
    * ROC plot
