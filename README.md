## Key findings

Alcohol is the most significant predictor of quality wine so interestingly, wines with higher alcohol contents have higher quality.

## Motivation 

## Data Source

- [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)

## Dataset Description

The dataset is related to life expectancy. Health factors for 193 countries have been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. The dataset consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows. The predictor variables are divided into several broad categories: Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors.

## Methods

- Multivariate correlation
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree
